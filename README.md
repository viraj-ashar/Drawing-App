Here I've created a Kids Drawing App in which you can draw as you wish.

-> In thish app you can change the background image of the canvas on which you can draw the outline of that image

-> We can even save the image and import any image.

-> We can change the size of our stroke in 3 sizes(small, medium and large).

-> We can select any color from the color pallete.

-> We can even do undo and redo operations.
